# JuliaMakerProjects

Welcome to the JuliaMaker's Project repository! This is a place where curated projects, using JuliaMaker packages or just Julia in general, can be posted. 

To submit a project, make a Pull Request, with the project in it's own directory.

## How do I make a Pull Request?
Never fear, the process goes something like the following:
- Fork this repository to your own github account.
- Create a new branch with ideally a descriptive name
- Create changes on that branch and commit them with a descriptive message
- Push the new branch to your forked JuliaMakerProjects repository
- Create a pull request using github.com interface.
Feel free to ask for help in the Julia Slack channel(#my-first-pr)

## How should My Project be organized?
- It should be inside of a directory with a name detailing the nature of the project
- That main directory should have descriptive subdirectories for disperate items. IE: Media, CAD, Julia, Arduino, etc.
- The main directory should contain a README.md file which describes the effort, your name(if you want), and how the project is organized. It can have other things too! Like links to a youtube video, or anything reasonable.

## Are There Any Rules?
Yes!
- Follow the code of conduct of the repository.
- Your project must be open source, MIT License.
- You don't have the right to edit anyone elses project unless they have given their express permission.
- Projects can be deleted at your request, but Git stores everything...
